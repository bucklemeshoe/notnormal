```
notnormal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main website page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           # All styling and responsive design

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple Static Hosting

1. **Download/Clone the files** to your local machine
2. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser to test locally
3. **Upload to any static hosting service**:
   - GitHub Pages
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Google Cloud Storage

### Option 2: Local Development Server

```bash
# Using Python (if you have Python installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have Node.js installed)
npx serve .

# Using PHP (if you have PHP installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## üîß Customization

### Update Branding
1. **Hero Section** - Edit the title, subtitle, and stats in `index.html`
2. **Color Scheme** - Modify CSS variables in `style.css` for brand colors
3. **Example Profiles** - Replace placeholder profile cards with real examples

### Form Configuration
1. **Add/Remove Fields** - Modify form fields in `index.html`
2. **Validation Rules** - Update validation logic in `script.js`
3. **File Types** - Change accepted file types in the JavaScript file upload handler

## üì§ Form Submission Setup

The current implementation includes a demonstration form handler. For production use, you'll need to implement backend processing:

### Option 1: Form Services (Easiest)
- **Netlify Forms** - Built-in form handling with Netlify hosting
- **Formspree** - Third-party form processing service
- **Google Forms** - Redirect to a Google Form for submissions

### Option 2: Custom Backend
- **Node.js/Express** - Server-side JavaScript processing
- **PHP** - Traditional server-side processing
- **Python/Flask** - Lightweight Python backend
- **Firebase Functions** - Serverless form processing

### Option 3: Integration APIs
- **Google Drive API** - Direct upload to Google Drive
- **Airtable API** - Store submissions in Airtable
- **Notion API** - Create database entries in Notion

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

The site includes placeholder Google Analytics tracking. To enable:

1. **Add your Google Analytics tracking ID**
2. **Include the gtag script** in the HTML head
3. **Uncomment tracking calls** in `script.js`

## üîí Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- File type validation (client and server-side)
- File size limits (10MB default)
- Virus scanning (recommended for production)
- Secure file storage with access controls

### Form Security  
- CSRF protection (implement server-side)
- Rate limiting for submissions
- Input sanitization and validation
- Spam protection (reCAPTCHA recommended)
